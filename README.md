# OpenCortex
OpenCortex is a fully-featured EEG streaming app to stream EEG data and markers.

- GUI to plot EEG in real-time
- signal filters (visualization only)
- signal quality estimators
- a button to save custom markers on the data
- an inlet stream that can receive event markers through LSL from an external source
- an outlet stream that can send raw EEG to an external source
- a general-purpose classifier class that can be initialized with any model from Scikit-Learn
- cross-validation plots with ROC curve and Confusion Matrix
- educational Jupyter notebooks to analyse EEG data using the library MNE and to perform classification tasks using Scikit-Learn.

## Supported Devices
- Any EEG board listed on (Brainflow)[https://brainflow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/SupportedBoards.html]
- (Coming Soon) Emotiv Epoc and other consumer EEG devices

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

List any software or dependencies that need to be installed before setting up the project.

- Python 3.6 or higher
- [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)

```bash
# Example: 
# Python 3
sudo apt-get install python3
```

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BRomans/CortexToolkit.git
cd CortexToolkit
```
2. Create a virtual environment
```bash
# Using venv
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows

```
3. Install the required packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Issues
The base requirement for bluetooth scanning is `pybluez2`, which is a Python wrapper for the BlueZ Linux Bluetooth stack.
There might be [issues](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74196428/pip-install-pybluez2-package-directory-bluetooth-macos-does-not-exist) installing the package from pip, so it is recommended to install it from the source.
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/airgproducts/pybluez2.git@0.46
```
Alternatively, you can install `pybluez`, which should silently be called instead of `pybluez2`.
If you encounter issues installing PyBluez, please refer to the latest comments on the project [issues page](https://github.com/pybluez/pybluez/issues/431).

## Usage
To run any example, use the following command:
```bash
cd examples
python <example_name>.py
```
To run the EEG Streamer app, use the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Examples
The [examples](examples) folder contains single runnable scripts that demonstrate how to handle data collected
using g.tec hardware.

## Notebooks
The [notebooks](notebooks) folder contains some examples on how to use the utilities provided in this repository. You 
can run the notebooks using Jupyter, Jupyter Lab or Google Colab.

## Building
This project can be built as pip package using the following commands

### Wheel Distribution
To build a wheel distribution, run the following command:
```bash
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```
Copy the content of the `dist` folder to the desired location and install the package using pip:
```bash
pip install <package_name>.whl
``` 

### Source Distribution
Alternatively, you if you want to build a source distribution, run the following command:
```bash
python setup.py sdist
```
Copy the content of the `dist` folder to the desired location and install the package using pip:
```bash
pip install <package_name>.tar.gz
```
